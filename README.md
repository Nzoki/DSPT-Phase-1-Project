Project description
Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. I'm going to help head of Microsoft's new movie studio decide what type of films to create.
I used the following data sets:-

tn.movie_budgets.csv
im.db.sqlite
For the analysis the following questions were answered:
 Which is the best time of the year to produce movies?
 Which studios produced most movies and which one had high gross incomes?- 
 Which is the most produced genre?
 Which genres are most successful in terms of profit making?

Technologies used
Various Python Libraries

Usage
This project demonstrates how various data cleaning and analysis models can be applied to come up with relevant advocacy. The analysis can be replicated in any similar data science use case.
